.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkeyring\fP manages a set of secrets in an encrypted datastore, called a
"keyring". Typically, these are username & password combinations to, e.g.,
website with which one has an accout.

\fBkeyring\fP's underlying datastore is designed to be recoverable without
\fBkeyring\fP: it is an \fBage\fP-encrypted ZIP file underneath, and you can
use those utilities to get at the contents. The exact format of the items
depends on what type of item it is, but generally, the items are JSON data, and
the meaning of their contents straight-forward.
